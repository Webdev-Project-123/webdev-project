With the digital revolution, learning has become immediate, real-time, and relevant whether you’re young, old, in the workforce, in school, or at home. As a learning and development professional, you’ve likely confronted the digital learning revolution armed with instructional design models from the pre-digital world. But today’s digital universe has a new model to address its wealth of new technologies and a new philosophy of learning experience design: learning cluster design. </p><p><em>Designing for Modern Learning: Beyond ADDIE and SAM</em> offers you and your learners a new way to learn. It describes the fundamental shift that has occurred in the nature of L&amp;D’s role as a result of the digital revolution and introduces a new five-step model: the Owens-Kadakia Learning Cluster Design Model (OK-LCD Model), a new five-step model for training design that meets the needs of modern learning. The model’s five steps or actions are an easy-to-follow mnemonic, CLUSTER:</p><ul><li>Change on-the-job behavior</li><li> Learn learner-to-learner differences</li><li> Upgrade existing assets</li><li> Surround learning with meaningful assets</li><li> Track transformation of Everyone’s Results. </li></ul><p>In each chapter, the authors share stories of business leaders, L&amp;D professionals, and learners who have successfully adopted the OK-LCD Model, detailing how they altered organizational mindsets to meet the needs of modern learners and their organizations. Included are how-to features, tools, tips, and real-life “in practice” sections. </p><p>This is an exciting time to be in L&amp;D. It’s time to join the revolution.</p></span>",

      "description": "<span><p/><p>Learn to create seamless designs backed by a responsible understanding of the human mind. This book examines how human behavior can be used to integrate your product design into lifestyle, rather than interrupt it, and make decisions for the good of those that are using your product. </p><p><i>Mindful Design</i> introduces the areas of brain science that matter to designers, and passionately explains how those areas affect each human’s day-to-day experiences with products and interfaces. You will learn about the neurological aspects and limitations of human vision and perception; about our attachment to harmony and dissonance, such as visual harmony, musical harmony; and about our brain’s propensity towards pattern recognition and how we perceive the world cognitively.  </p><p>In the second half of the book you will focus on the practical application of what you have learned, specific to interaction and interface design. Real-world examples are used throughout so that you can really see how design is impacting our everyday digital experience.<br/></p><p>Design is a responsibility, but not enough designers understand the human mind or the process of thought. This book explores the key factors involved and shows you how to make the right design choices.<br/></p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><p/><ul><li>Review how attention and distraction work and the cost of attentional switching<br/></li><li>Use Gestalt principles to communicate visual grouping<br/></li><li>Ensure your underlying models make sense to your audience<br/></li><li>Use time, progression, and transition to create a composition<br/></li><li>Carefully examine controlling behavior through reductionist and behaviorist motivation concepts <br/></li><li>Apply the theoretical knowledge to practical, mindful application design<br/></li></ul><p/><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>\n\nThe primary audience for this book is professional designers who wish to learn more about the human mind and how to apply that to their work. The book is also useful for design-focussed product owners and startup founders who wish to apply ethical thinking to a team, or when bootstrapping their products. The secondary audience is design students who are either studying a ‘traditional’ visual design course, or a UX/interaction design course who have a desire to learn how they might be able to apply mindful design to their early careers. Finally, a tertiary audience for this book would be tutors involved in teaching design, or peripheral, courses who may wish to incorporate its teachings into their lectures, workshops or seminars.<p/><br/><p/>\n  </span>",

Go from initial design through prototyping and implementation to deployment of mission-critical APIs for your organization. Test, secure, and deploy your API with confidence and avoid the \"release into production\" panic. Tackle just about any API challenge with more than a dozen open-source utilities and common programming patterns you can apply right away.</p><p>Good API design means starting with the API-First principle - understanding who is using the API and what they want to do with it - and applying basic design skills to match customers' needs while solving business-critical problems. Use the Sketch-Design-Build method to create reliable and scalable web APIs quickly and easily without a lot of risk to the day-to-day business operations. Create clear sequence diagrams, accurate specifications, and machine-readable API descriptions all reviewed, tested, and ready to turn into fully-functional NodeJS code.</p><p>Create reliable test collections with Postman and implement proper identity and access control security with AuthO-without added cost or risk to the company. Deploy all of this to Heroku using a continuous delivery approach that pushes secure, well-tested code to your public servers ready for use by both internal and external developers.</p><p>From design to code to test to deployment, unlock hidden business value and release stable and scalable web APIs that meet customer needs and solve important business problems in a consistent and reliable manner.</p></div></span>",
